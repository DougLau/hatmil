Simple HTML builder

With an [Html] builder, elements can be created using methods with a matching
name, such as [a], [body], [div], or [table].  These methods return an [Elem],
which borrows from the `Html`, and can be closed with the [end] method.
[VoidElem] elements, like [img] and [input], do not need to be closed.

Text content can be added using the [text] or [text_len] methods, which will
automatically escape characters as needed.  For content which has already been
escaped, use the [raw] method.

After creating all elements, use `String::from(html)` to get the HTML.
All open tags will be closed automatically.

```rust
use hatmil::Html;

let mut html = Html::new();
html.div().id("a_div").text("Hello").end();
html.button().class("rounded").text("Press Me!");
let html = String::from(html);
assert_eq!(
    html,
    "<div id=\"a_div\">Hello</div><button class=\"rounded\">Press Me!</button>"
);
```
